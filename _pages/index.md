Eager to learn, motivated and creative web developer and web designer with understanding of usability, accessibility and style, clean code and beautiful, modern web solutions.

As a web developer who made a shift from studying and teaching human language as a means of communication from linguistic, social and artistic points of view, and a passionate and inquisitive gooder always learning new (both human and programming) languages and techniques, and also mentoring others, I believe I can be a real asset in a multidisciplinary team offering new ideas and insights to help solve problems in creative and user friendly ways.

I am extremely interested in projects that have impact via social change and that help make the world a better place.

Ideally, I would love to combine the various skills I possess in a hybrid role in a multidisciplinary team.
