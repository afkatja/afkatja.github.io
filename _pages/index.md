Web developer by day and nature and wildlife photographer in between, planning to make the shift towards professionalizing my passion for photography.

I am an eager to learn, motivated and creative web developer with thorough understanding of usability, accessibility and style, clean code and beautiful, modern and elegant web solutions. I am a developer who made a shift from studying and teaching human language as a means of communication from linguistic, social and artistic points of view to learning and using programming languages as a means of communication. Originally, I was trained in teaching languages and literature at school. After a while I came to understanding language in its philosophical broad sense of a means of communication. One of the examples of this “language” is photography and film.

I am also a passionate and inquisitive gooder always learning new (both human and programming) languages and techniques. I am extremely interested in projects that have impact via social change and that help make the world a better place. As a co-founder of [Girl Code](http://girl-code.nl), I also tried to inspire and mentor others by organizing the [regular events](http://meetup.com/girlcode), helping underrepresented groups to enter or stay in the field of technology.
