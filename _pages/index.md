I am an eager to learn, motivated and creative web developer with thorough understanding of usability, accessibility and style, clean code and beautiful, modern and elegant web solutions.

I am a web developer who made a shift from studying and teaching human language as a means of communication from linguistic, social and artistic points of view. I am also a passionate and inquisitive gooder always learning new (both human and programming) languages and techniques.

Together with other co-founders of [Girl Code](http://girl-code.nl), I also try to inspire and mentor others by organizing the [regular events](http://meetup.com/girlcode), helping underrepresented groups to enter or stay in the field of programming.

I believe I can be a real asset in a multidisciplinary team offering new ideas and insights to help solve problems in creative and user friendly ways. I am extremely interested in projects that have impact via social change and that help make the world a better place.
