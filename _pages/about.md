# About me
I am Katja Hollaar, 36, from The Hague, the Netherlands. Originally from Ukraine, I moved to the Netherlands in 2003. Here I made a carreer switch from the teacher of Russian language and world literature to web development with an intermezzo of Communication Science.

I used to be a linguist. I used to research and teach the grammar rules and, most importantly, the philosophy of the language. That fascinated me, the way language reflects the mentality of the people, the way all human languages reflect their common roots and how this fact shows the history of humanity.

 So the language plays a very important role in my daily life, both human languages and programming languages. I love to learn; my current (and on-going) study objectives are Italian and Swift. I wouldn't say you can compare them as the protagonist of _Mr Penumbra's 24 Hour Bookstore_ compared programming languages:

> Programming is not all the same. Normal written languages have different rhythms and idioms, right? Well, so do programming languages. The language called C is all harsh imperatives, almost raw computer-speak. The language called Lisp is like one long, looping sentence, full of subclauses, so long in fact that you usually forget what it was even about in the first place. The language called Erlang is just like it sounds: eccentric and Scandinavian.
(Robin Sloan, _Mr Penumbra's 24 Hour Bookstore_)

I like that quote; it serves its purpose as a rhetoric device. In my case, I love Italian which has a long history, and Swift seems a modern, stable and pretty language to work with.
