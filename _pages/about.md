I am Katja Hollaar, from The Hague, the Netherlands. Originally from Ukraine, I moved to the Netherlands in 2003. Here I made a career switch from the teacher of Russian language and world literature to web developer with an intermezzo of Master of Arts in Communication Science.

I used to be a linguist. I used to research and teach the grammar rules and, most importantly, the philosophy of the language. That fascinated me, the way language reflects the mentality of the people, the way all human languages manifest their common roots and how this fact illustrates the history of humanity. So the language has always played a very important role in my daily life. During my work as a web developer I have been fascinated by how programming languages can reflect the way human languages are organized and evolve. Programming languages are created by people using human languages, and thus, inevitably, people would take the concepts and elements from their native languages into what they create (originally, of course, as the programming languages evolve rapidly and might lose any resemblance with what might have inspired their creation). Currently, as I am making steps towards my next carreer switch to photography, I am interested in researching the ways visual language helps influence our perceptions of the world around us. My main topics are nature and, most importantly, wildlife photography.
